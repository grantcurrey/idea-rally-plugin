idea-rally-plugin
=================

This plugin alows you to interact with [rally](http://www.rallydev.com) from within your intellij ide.

Currently it supports:

# Selecting current or future iterations associated with your default project
# Viewing the stories / defects associated with the selected iteration.

Still under development with the following features planned:

# Show Story / Defect details
# Create / Update tasks associated with a Story / Defect
# Select the project, rather than working off the rally default (in your profile)
# Integration with commit's allowing you to update / complete a rally task.
